# Friends
A Web Chat app that uses sockets to update in real time (duh)

## Why?
I tried to make discord clone first but I needed to learn how to use sockets first, so here it is

## Demo:
No.

## Tech:
- Vite/React
- TailwindCSS
- Prisma.io
- Socket.io

## Notes:
I forgot to upload this project in github so here it is, anyway bye ðŸ™‚
